This file includes single inheritance, multiple inheritance, polimorphism classes with few examples.
The attributes and methords can be call and over write from the main parent class if the class is inherited by parent class. 
The method resolution order and multiple inheritance can be find from diamond example. 
The method resolution order is if the class inherited by mutiple inheritance from two or more parent classes, it will start reading attributes or methords from the frist parent class. (first comes first)
